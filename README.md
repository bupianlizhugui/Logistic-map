# Logistic-map


The logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how **complex**, **chaotic** behaviour can arise from **very simple non-linear** dynamical equations. (Read more at: 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map),
[Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticMap.html) )

 **The Equation: X<sub>t+1</sub> = r*X<sub>t</sub>(1 - X<sub>t</sub> )**

To observe the dynamic behaviour, we initialised X with 0.1 and 0.1000000001 (Difference at 10<sup>th</sup> decimal position) and plug it into the above equation.

Below are the graphs that plot the values for different values of 'r'
